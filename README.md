# WidentiFi
WidentiFi is a simple iOS app + Today Extension to let you *quickly* check which Wi-Fi network you are connected to. That's it.

##Why?
Sometimes you find yourself in a location with multiple available networks and it can be handy to know which one you are actively connected to. The ideal place for this information would be in the Status Bar or even the Control Center. Unfortunately, the information isn't there. The only way to get the SSID for your current Wi-Fi connection is via the Settings app. Not exactly convenient (especially if you're already using another app).

This is where WidentiFi can help. It includes a handy Today Extension so you can simply pull down your Notification Center and verify your Wi-Fi connection any time you like.

##Any other reasons?
I enjoy programming in Swift and I wanted to share something (hopeuflly) useful on GitHub. :)
